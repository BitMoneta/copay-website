          h4.dark.fade-in When we realized that we needed a more secure way to hold bitcoin, we decided to build our own.
          h5.dark.fade-in Many of our own team members live on bitcoin, and we knew we needed to make wallet security that would work for full-time bitcoin users. With that in mind, we created Copay, one of the first projects to bring the security and shareability of multisignature wallets together in a flexible finance tool for individuals and groups.
          h5.dark.fade-in From Copay's earliest days, we've been 100% open source, working with an international community of developers to build a wallet users could control – and secure – themselves. Now it's out of beta, and we're ready to share version 1.0.
